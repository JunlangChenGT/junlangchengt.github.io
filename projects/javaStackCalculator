This was for an assignment in the second Java class in the University of Hawaii at Manoa. It's purpose was to improve familiarity of array stacks and linked stacks.

There isn't much to it. The stack is used to buffer number inputs and when an operator is entered, the operation is performed on the numbers stored in the stack.

Here is some code that illustrates how we read values from the line sensors:

```cpp
byte ADCRead(byte ch)
{
    word value;
    ADC1SC1 = ch;
    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
    }
    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
}
```
