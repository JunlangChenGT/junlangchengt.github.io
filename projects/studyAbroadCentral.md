This is a web application created over the course of three weeks for a group project in an introductory software engineering class. It is based off of a React-Meteor template called [meteor-application-template-react](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template-react/).

There are three organizations that host information concerning study abroad programs for students studying at UH Manoa.

This application gives an introduction of each of the three organization and keeps a list of study abroad programs using MongoDB.
