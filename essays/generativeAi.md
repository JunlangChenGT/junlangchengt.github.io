    Today I increment the integer which most humans on this planet measure their age with. <s>When I was a young whipper-snapper...</s> Two decades ago, I was told that the reason why I couldn't use a calculator while doing my arithmetic homework was that I wouldn't always carry a calculator with me. It made sense at the time, but cometh the two thousand and seventh year of our Lord, people started carrying pocket computers with internet access everywhere they went. To this day, I still perform most of my calculations involving just the four core mathematical functions mentally, even though I'm bad at keeping track of digits and would save me a good amount of effort if I had just keyed it in. Years roll by and the increases in computational speed and the availability of cheap data storage allow megacorporations to train large language models which can accurately mimic human language responses with information that isn't entirely detached from reality. Thus, the equivalent of the four function calculator, but for every academic study is unleashed unto the world. Interestingly, even at this early state of development, these "generative AIs" are quite proficient in writing short code snippets. As academic institutions from around the world struggle to come to terms with what might be a paradime shift in humanity's future, the instructors from my introductory software engineering course decide to roll with <s>punches</s> oncoming tsunami, allowing full usage of any generative AI for all the coursework. This is only supposed to be a test to measure the differences in student performance, but I can't see how a non AI policy is enforceable. Pandora's box has been opened, but is it all that bad? Even starting from my precalculus class in high school, I was expected to use a graphing calculator, as drawing graphs and finding intersections manually were deemed an inefficient use of time and effort.

<h2>Personal Experiences with Generative AI</h2>
<h3>In-class Practice WODs</h3>
<p>
    For clarification, the course places heavy weighting for a weekly "Workout of the Day", often referred to as WOD. These are all or nothing coding tests designed to be completed within an hour. In preparation for these graded WODS, a practice WOD of similar content is held in class in advance. Near the beginning of the semester, the WODs were mostly concerned with the Javascript language, where the problems were simple enough where generative AI could return passing code on the first try. However, since it was only practice, I would try to get to the solution without using it until I got stuck or the deadline approached, where in a matter of seconds I get presented with a solution which might take me a few tens of minutes to consider.
