    Today I increment the integer which most humans on this planet measure their age with. <s>When I was a young whipper-snapper...</s> Two decades ago, I was told that the reason why I couldn't use a calculator while doing my arithmetic homework was that I wouldn't always carry a calculator with me. It made sense at the time, but cometh the two thousand and seventh year of our Lord, people started carrying pocket computers with internet access everywhere they went. To this day, I still perform most of my calculations involving just the four core mathematical functions mentally, even though I'm bad at keeping track of digits and would save me a good amount of effort if I had just keyed it in. Years roll by and the increases in computational speed and the availability of cheap data storage allow megacorporations to train large language models which can accurately mimic human language responses with information that isn't entirely detached from reality. Thus, the equivalent of the four function calculator, but for every academic study is unleashed unto the world. Interestingly, even at this early state of development, these "generative AIs" are quite proficient in writing short code snippets. As academic institutions from around the world struggle to come to terms with what might be a paradime shift in humanity's future, the instructors from my introductory software engineering course decide to roll with <s>punches</s> oncoming tsunami, allowing full usage of any generative AI for all the coursework. This is only supposed to be a test to measure the differences in student performance, but I can't see how a non AI policy is enforceable. Pandora's box has been opened, but is it all that bad? Even starting from my precalculus class in high school, I was expected to use a graphing calculator, as drawing graphs and finding intersections manually were deemed an inefficient use of time and effort.

<h2>Personal Experiences with Generative AI</h2>
<h3>In-class Practice WODs</h3>
<p>
    For clarification, the course places heavy weighting for a weekly "Workout of the Day", often referred to as WOD. These are all or nothing coding tests designed to be completed within an hour. In preparation for these graded WODs, a practice WOD of similar content is held in class in advance. Near the beginning of the semester, the WODs were mostly concerned with the Javascript language, where the problems were simple enough where generative AI could return passing code on the first try. However, since it was only practice, I would try to get to the solution without using it until I got stuck or the deadline approached, where in a matter of seconds, ChatGPT3.5 presents me a solution which might take me a few tens of minutes to consider. Later in the semester, the course material progressed faster than my proficiency, leading me to start using ChatGPT as an "I win" button until the focus of the class started turning to frameworks, where it were less useful.
</p>
<h3>In-class WODs</h3>
<p>
    I tried not to use generative AI at the beginning of the semester. I managed to keep it up for a few weeks until I got stuck one day and spent 20 minutes signing up for a ChatGPT account. My behavior eventually defaulting to starting off with ChatGPT and spend the rest of the time studying the structure of the code. Usage stopped after WODs shifted focus to frameworks, since they started having more granular instructions. There would be multiple files involved, so the prompts for ChatGPT would be super long and I don't trust it to keep internal consistency throughout its solution.
</p>
<h3>Experience WODs</h3>
<p>
    In addition to the in class WODs, the class has take-home WODs to familiarize students with languages, functions, frameworks, and services. I feel like the use of generative AI isn't even applicable to the ones outside the Javascript exercises.
</p>
<h3>Essays</h3>
<p>
    Although ChatGPT is most infamous in its use by students who use it to write essays for them, I have yet to use it to create anything more than barebone outlines for anything. Its writing style reminds me of that of a middle schooler and is incapable of replicating my sarcasm.
</p>
<h3>Final project</h3>
<p>
    I have yet to use generative AI for the final group project. ChatGPT's database is intentionally kept a few years behind the present, so it lacks detailed information regarding the latest versions of Bootstrap-React.
</p>
<h3>Learning a concept / tutorial</h3>
<p>
    I don't think I've done anything to learn concepts using generative AI other than to (re)learn the syntax for arrow functions with Javascript.
</p>
<h3>Answering a question in class or in Discord</h3>
<p>
    I believe that the questions brought up in class and in the class's Discord server are niche enough for generative AI not to have the ability to solve.
</p>
<h3>Asking or answering a smart-question</h3>
<p>
    Given the fact that most of the questions in the smart-questions channel are for help with troubleshooting npm problems, I'm not sure how much generative AI would help, though I have yet to try to use one for that purpose.
