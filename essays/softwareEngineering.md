    Now that you are almost done with this class, I would like you to write on last essay that summarizes what you’ve learned about software engineering.

Because the technology stack for this class is designed for the creation of web applications, some students think this class is simply about web application development. Of course, web application development is a skill you’ve acquired in this class, but the more fundamental goal of this class is for you to acquire experience with fundamental software engineering concepts including:

    Open Source Software Development
    Configuration Management
    Functional Programming
    Development Environments
    Coding Standards
    User Interface Frameworks
    Agile Project Management
    Design Patterns
    Ethics in Software Engineering

For this essay, reflect on what you learned about software engineering in general during this course, by taking two or three of these topics and discussing what they mean beyond web application development. For example, you learned about a style of Agile Project Management called Issue Driven Project Management. Could you see yourself using that project management style for a project not involving web applications? If so, then discuss what Agile Project Management is, what Issue Driven Project Management is, and how you could see yourself applying it to different project contexts.

Be careful and do not assume the reader understands what “configuration management” or “design patterns” or whatever means. You must define these terms if you are using them.

    My introductory software engineering course curriculum had base HTML and CSS, JavaScript, JavaScript's Underscore library, the Bootstrap framework, Facebook's React framework, and the Meteor-React framework for MongoDB integration. Apparently learning process of these web development tools is supposed to generalize to the rest of software engineering.
</p>
<h2>Development Environments</h2>
<p>
    The only IDE used in this course is Jetbrains Intellij. Out of all the Jetbrains products, I've only used Pycharm. I only have passing familiarity with Rider through watching my friends use their preferred IDE for C# and C++.
</p>
<h2>Agile Project Management</h2>
<p>
    The final project for the course used a form of agile project management called issue driven project management, where incomplete and broken features are divided up into smaller todos. My group used projects in a GitHub repository to create a new milestone for every week we worked on the project. Each milestone is divided into ten issues distributed across the five members of the group. Ten was a project requirement for the class, so it sometimes resulted in unnecessary breakdowns in tasks and uneven workload distribution.
</p>
<p>
    I do often look at my friends' personal projects so issue driven project management is nothing new to me. A pattern I've noticed is that the issues for bigger projects are first categorized by function to maintain readability because there may be many tens or even hundreds of issues. There isn't much for me to say about this topic as I can't think of another way to keep track of the development of a project. It'll be akin to explaining why the wheel is often the ideal ground interface for the transportation of mass in an environment with normal force and friction.
</p>
<p>
    For much larger projects that involve many hundreds or thousands of programmers contributing code, such as of FAANG's software as a service products, the "go fast break things" mentality probably stops working at the level of design decisions, where lining up many moving parts become important. 
</p>
<h2>Ethics in Software Engineering</h2>
<p>
    Given that there was one whole 75 minute classroom section dedicated to discussing a singular ethical problem in the entirety of the course, it seems evident that ethics isn't one of its core aspects. I do not have high hopes for the future, considering almost half the class argued that working to develop shoddy identification software for law enforcement is an ethical act. I find this disturbing, and this is coming from someone who wouldn't bat an eye building missiles that'll be used to blow up children.
