## In the context of programming
A good 50% of my interactions with other human beings are with software developers. I have yet to meet one who likes Javascript as a programming language. One, a Rust evangelist, claims that Javascript forces people to write bad code. Another, whom I asked just now about Javascript, replied: "Something something the language was created in 10 days and it shows." I did some digging, and indeed, Javascript was created in the span of a week, was meant for running pop ups on the ancient web, and now somehow is a core component in the function of many websites. Douglas Crockford, the inventor of JSON, in an interview, said that Javascript should be replaced with new languages. I'm inclined to agree.

Javascript frameworks turned the modern web into a buggy and laggy mess. Run into a problem? Get another framework! Need to update your website after a few months of not touching it? Oops, it's broken because these libraries aren't compatible with each other.

There is a reason why there's an option to disable Javascript in ublock origin. Through webRTC, they can completely deanonymize users. I understand why a website needs to know my OS to give me the correct format, but why does it want my machine specs and IP?

There are some weird design decisions in the language. Why is the is equals to written ===? What is the point of the third equal sign? Why are numbers objects? Why is NaN an object? Why is it a subclass of number? Why are functions classes? Why do I get "" as a return from [] + []?

Adobe Flash and Java applets have gone the way of the dinosaur. I believe Javascript should follow in kind.
