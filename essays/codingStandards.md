I have yet to collaborate with anyone in a project involving code. What can I possibly say about coding standards? Over the past week, I only had ESLint enforce its standard onto my bits of code which probably don't even total to a hundred lines. It only dealt with code style and formatting, which did fix some annoying typos here and there, and I did like how it added comments concerning the variables and functions, but I don't believe that it does much to affect the readability of code. So once again my personal experience fails me and I have to rely on the experiences of the people I know.

So I know some people who work on custom shaders that run in the Unity engine (I really hope that the expertise is transferable due to recent events). A recurring challenge for them is that when someone new starts writing shaders, it's often difficult for others already in the community to utilize because it's written so differently from what passes as the norm.

I do know that more important than adding a space after a // for a comment or adding a new line after the last line of code, is that there should be some convention which everyone likely to write or look at the code should understand and follow. I have heard that most of the time a developer spends is not writing code, but understanding someone else's code. Familiarity is important. 

Case: Any Walmart in North America. Walk into any of them, and you likely already know where to find what you want because the sections are laid out the same: clothes are foodstuffs in the front, home and electronics in the back. 

It is extremely unlikely that a sole person supports the entirety of a large codebase, so any code written should be quickly understandable and locatable. The names of things need to be standardized so that they can be easily searched. The placement of the things, both in the code file and without, need to be familiar, just like Walmart.
